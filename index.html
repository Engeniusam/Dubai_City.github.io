  <center><h2>Dubai Architecture</h2></center>
  <p>Dubai is a bucket list destination, ready to wow any traveler with its cloud-reaching skyscrapers—most of which are known around the world as feats of architecture in height or just eye-catching aesthetic. From above, it's hard to imagine that the space that now holds a wealth of business and enterprise that's around every corner was once a modest fishing village. The city hub has made leaps and bounds—but take a trip a couple of miles out of town into the Arabian Desert, and you'll be greeted with an entirely new (and age-old) scene: Earth-toned sand dunes stretched across the horizon and heavy-footed camels trekking toward the Western Hajar Mountains, which signals entry to Oman. Head south of Dubai and you'll find a topaz paradise, more commonly known as the Persian Gulf. There aren't many places in the world where you can take in such a range of environments in one camera frame. </p>
